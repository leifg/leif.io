The blockchain universe is quite the universe. I have a lot of thoughts on this technology and I am taking a rather extreme position:

> The only use case for public blockchains is: Assigning ownership of certain digital assets without a central authority

"Certain digital assets" in reality pretty much means cryptocurrencies (I use the term digital assets because that use case also applies to cryptokitties and possibly other digital assets/collectibles I'm not aware of).

For everything else blockchain has **no advantage** over classic data storage solutions.

I gathered all articles that touch on this topic here on this page. If you are interested in other sources, check my [reading list](/ultimate-list-of-web3-blockchain-resources).
