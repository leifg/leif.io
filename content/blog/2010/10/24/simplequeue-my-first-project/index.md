![queue](header.jpg)

Today I released my first project on [github](http://github.com/leifg/simplequeue). It's called [simplequeue](http://github.com/leifg/simplequeue) and is a little tool to queue tasks. In this case everything is a task which can be expressed in a single line of text.

It's written in ruby and as I'm new to ruby I would really appreciate it if someone took the time and make a code review. Just [contact me](http://grepthepipe.com/contact.html) or fork the project if you have suggestions.

I also added a [portfolio](http://grepthepipe.com/portfolio.html) page to this site. I will do my best to add more projects to my portfolio.
