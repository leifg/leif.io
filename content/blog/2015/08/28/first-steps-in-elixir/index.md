From time to time I look into new programming languages. But usually I rarely do more than browse the general introduction guide.

However this time I dove a little bit deeper into [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and even got myself a [pet project](https://github.com/leifg/excellent).

I tried to find a use case for a little library and I ended up writing a [parser for Excel documents](https://github.com/leifg/excellent). It's still under heavy development but I gladly accept Pull-Requests.
