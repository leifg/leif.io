Or at least I think that is what I am going to do.

Currently I'm playing around with [ghost](http://ghost.io).

It doesn't have the fancy nerd stuff (yes it's only editable online and does not live on github) but I like the interface and am hoping for some awesome third party support.

And it's not Wordpress.

If you're wondering why this is not the first article: I imported some of the more popular blog posts from my old blog.
